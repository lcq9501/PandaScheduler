# PandaScheduler

## About
PandaScheduler is a platform for requesting and receiving help.  Students can
to request a tutoring session based on a class, topic, and avaliablity.
Mentors (other students) will see lists of these requests and respond
accordingly.

PandaScheduler was created out of need for
[CS 370L](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LvyX1pjvq83MPHH74jc4vOeZHDmU-D6bSV90DalRKx4/edit).

In the future, we hope to extend this platform to include more regular events
(Office Hours), and also special events (class sponsered review sessions).


## "Version 0.1" Planned Features
- Authentication -- accounts with @berkeley.edu addresses only.
    + You can easily change this to suit any university of your choice. :P
- Requesting help on specific topics
    + Topics pulled from course syllabus
- Responding to help requests
- Feedback on tutoring sessions
- Sort by Class and Topic


### Future "Dream" Features
- "Single Source of Truth" for all scheduling needs (OH, Reviews, maybe
     even discussions?!)
- Integration with Google Calendar
- More robust request and feedback system


## Setup
You'll need [Python2](http://www.python.org/download/) and
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

After installing those, you should be able to run the app:

    python pandagrader.py


## Does this have anything to do with PandaGrader?
Not actually. I just thought it would be funny if people started
creating studentland tools with names starting with "Panda".
